We implemented cloth using a mass spring system. The functionality of our cloth includes:
    1. Cloth tearing
    2. Cloth movement dependent on wind
    3. User interaction with cloth
    4. Cloth collision with a sphere
    5. Cloth collision with the floor

User Manual:
1. Build
    "mkdir build", "cd build", "cmake ..", "make", "./bin/cloth"
2. World controls
    Press "C" to toggle between zoom/fps similar to the menger sponge project
3. Cloth controls
    Press "J" to show/hide the springs
    Press "K" to show/hide the texture
    Press "R" to reset the cloth
    Press "CTRL" and use the mouse right click to drag the cloth (you can't drag very far due to constraints we set)
4. Wind controls
    Press "T" to start/stop wind
    Press "-" to decrease wind intensity
    Press "=" to increase wind intensity
    Press "P" to change wind direction
5. Tearing
    Use the mouse left click to tear the cloth where the mouse is
6. Sphere controls
    Press "O" to show/hide the sphere
    Press "I" to stop/start the movement of the sphere
